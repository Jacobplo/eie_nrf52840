git add
  Stages changes to be committed. Used for controlling what is going to be committed.
  git add {directory or file}

git commit
  Used to confirm changes that have been made, after they have been staged with git add, and saving them in the local repo
  git commit -m "message";
  
git branch
  Creates a separately tracked branch, which you can make commits on, that are kept separate from other branches. This is good for making changes that might not work, so that main still works.
  git branch branchName

git checkout
  Switches the branch that the user is currently on to the one chosen, so that the user can make changes on that branch.
  git checkout branchName
  Use with -b to create a branch before switching to it.

git pull
  Copies the locally untracked commits from the remote repo to the local repo.
  git pull -u origin branchName

git push
  Copies the remotely untracked commits from the local repo to the remote repo.
  git push -u origin branchName
  After initial push of a new branch:
    git push;

git merge
  Merges all of the commits from one branch into another.
  If on branch1, use the command to merge changes from branch2.
  git merge branch2;

git rebase
  Like merge, but instead moves the commits of another branch directly to the current branch, while the current branch still points to where it originally did.
  git rebase branch2;

git fetch
  Pulls commits from the remote repo without changing where the local branches point do. Commits are only downloaded, and not merged.
  git fetch;

git status
  Shows what has and has not yet been staged for commit.
  git status

git log
  Shows commit history for different branches, including author, date, branch, and where the HEAD is located.
